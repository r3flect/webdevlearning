    <hr />

    <h3>Ford v. Ferrari</h3>
    <p>Very good movie and made me cry</p>

    <h3>Fast 5</h3>
    <p>Loved this series as a kid and this was my favourite out of them. Loved the actor Paul Walker.</p>

    <h3>Inside Out 2</h3>
    <p>I know its a kid's movie but it shows alot of norms seen today in society and makes it aware that its okay to grow up hand feel alot of emotions.</p>
